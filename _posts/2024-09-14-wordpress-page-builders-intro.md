# Page Builder
## Definition 
A page builder is a tool or plugin that allows you to create and design individual pages on your site using a drag-and-drop interface. It gives you more control over specific page layouts without needing to write code.
##  Scope
Used on a per-page basis, allowing for custom layouts, designs, and elements that can be different from the default theme layout.
## Customization
Provides extensive customization options for individual pages, such as custom grids, columns, widgets, buttons, and more, often with a live preview.
## Purpose
To create highly customized page designs, landing pages, or content layouts without touching the core theme’s design.
## Example
Plugins like Elementor, WPBakery, and Beaver Builder are popular page builders that allow users to design pages with more flexibility than a theme’s basic editor.
