# WordPress Theme
## Definition
A WordPress theme is a pre-designed template that determines the overall look, design, and layout of your WordPress website. It dictates the appearance of headers, footers, colors, typography, and sometimes page layouts.
## Scope
Affects the entire site. Changing the theme changes the design site-wide.
## Customization
Themes can have a limited or extensive set of customization options, depending on the theme itself. Some themes are very rigid in structure, while others offer more flexibility (e.g., through customizer options or additional theme settings).
## Purpose
Provides the visual structure of the website, including responsiveness, styling, and layout.
## Example
A theme like "Astra" or "Kadence" dictates how the site's overall design appears.
